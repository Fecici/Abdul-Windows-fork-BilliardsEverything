# Abdul Windows Release Report

Date: 2026-07-14

Primary source tree: Abdul Windows, `-Abdul-s-fork-BilliardsEverything`

Comparison names used in this report:

- Abdul Windows: this active Windows source tree.
- Nick Shan Linux: the Linux port and `Project_Improvement_Report.md`.
- Suryansh Mac: the older Mac/runtime line and build assumptions reflected in the source/build files.
- Main runtime: the built Windows runtime/jar/backend artifacts studied earlier. Treat as runtime evidence, not source truth.

This report is meant to ship with the test build. It explains what changed, why it changed, what risk remains, and how volunteers should run the program.

## Executive Summary

The Abdul Windows tree now builds the JavaFX frontend and native C++ backend through Gradle on Windows/MSYS2 UCRT64. The release work focused on correctness, memory pressure, cancellation safety, Windows build reliability, and making the UI usable enough for volunteer testing.

The most important release changes are:

- Fixed Windows native build/link issues for MSYS2/UCRT64.
- Targeted Java 17 explicitly.
- Preserved the intended runtime memory settings: `-Xms2g`, `-Xmx10g`, `MaxDirectMemorySize=2g`.
- Limited Gradle compile pressure with `org.gradle.workers.max=2`.
- Added a user-facing app thread argument, `--threads=N`.
- Pushed the resolved Java thread count into the native backend.
- Fixed the reflected viewer being shifted vertically by pinning the image stack to the actual 600x600 image size.
- Added an `Add to Cover` checkbox next to the existing top Calculate button.
- Added duplicate guards so that Calculate does not insert the same cover line twice.
- Ported or independently implemented the highest-value Nick Shan Linux fixes: numeric tolerance, Vary4 geometry typo, stale cover guard, pixel bounds guard, evaluator reuse, render batching/coalescing, DB connection ownership, code canonicalization, and pattern-finder string building.
- Deferred database relocation because changing user data paths needs a deliberate migration plan.

## Change Register

### BUG-001: Native Numeric Convergence

Files:

- `src/backend/headers/newton.hpp`
- `src/backend/headers/intersection.hpp`

Bug:

Abdul Windows used extremely tight numeric thresholds around Newton solving and intersection checks. On long OSNO and cover paths this risks false non-convergence or intervals that are too brittle for practical MPFR/MPFI work.

Fix:

Changed the tolerance/fudge values to `1e-25`, matching the Nick Shan Linux evidence.

Philosophy:

This code needs certified-enough interval behavior in the real application, not a tolerance so tight that valid long inputs become unstable. The fix follows the Linux port because it was already tested against large cases.

Conditions:

Most relevant when calculating long OSNO sequences, covers, MRRs, and recursive stable/unstable checks.

Significance:

High correctness risk. A bad tolerance can produce wrong empty/non-empty or convergence behavior.

Validation:

`compileJava backendSharedLibrary` passed. Long manual OSNO comparison is still recommended.

### BUG-002: Vary4 Right-List Geometry Typo

File:

- `src/backend/cpp/triangle_billiard4.cpp`

Bug:

The `reconfigure(false)` branch looped over the right-side candidate list but indexed the left-side list. That can produce wrong geometry or an out-of-bounds read if the lists differ.

Fix:

Changed the right-side branch to index `R[i]`, matching Nick Shan Linux.

Philosophy:

This is a direct correctness bug, not an optimization. The loop variable and source list must match.

Conditions:

Vary4 calculations that generate unequal left/right candidate lists.

Significance:

High. Wrong candidate geometry can poison later vary output.

Validation:

Native backend compiled. Manual Vary4 cases with unequal candidate lists should be tested.

### BUG-003: Stale Cover Artifact Crash

File:

- `src/java/billiards/cover/CoverStuff.java`

Bug:

`cover.txt` stores indexes into companion `stables.txt` and `triples.txt`. If files are stale or manually edited, an index can point past the available list and crash load.

Fix:

Added bounds checks. Bad entries warn and skip instead of crashing the viewer.

Philosophy:

Runtime artifacts are user-editable and often carried between versions. Loading should be defensive.

Conditions:

Opening old, partial, hand-edited, or version-mismatched cover folders.

Significance:

Medium stability. Prevents volunteer tests from failing on stale artifacts.

Validation:

Compile passed. Manual stale-cover load test still recommended.

### BUG-004: AutoVary Pixel Bounds

Files:

- `src/java/billiards/viewer/PolyVaryTask.java`
- `src/java/billiards/viewer/CycleVaryTask.java`

Bug:

Pixel reads could happen outside image bounds after zoom, reflection, or edge rounding.

Fix:

Added image-null and pixel-bound checks. Interrupted pixel probes preserve interrupt state.

Philosophy:

AutoVary should skip impossible screen probes rather than crash an entire search.

Conditions:

Zoomed/reflected views, edge pixels, and cancellation.

Significance:

Medium stability.

Validation:

Compile passed. Manual AutoPolyVary and CycleVary edge tests remain important.

### BUG-005: Interrupt And Executor Lifecycle Audit

Status:

Still planned.

Files:

- `src/java/billiards/viewer/*.java`

Issue:

Some Java tasks still need a full audit for interrupted catches, executor shutdown, cancel timing, and partial-progress preservation.

Why Not Fully Closed:

Several higher-confidence correctness and memory fixes were prioritized first. Abdul Windows already has `Utils.safeShutdownExecutor` and `shutdownExecutorAsync`, so this should be audited carefully rather than blindly ported from Nick Shan Linux.

Significance:

Medium. Mostly affects cancellation, shutdown, and long-running tasks.

Next Test:

Start cover, AutoVary, CycleVary, and Vary tasks, cancel each while work is active, and confirm progress is preserved and no runaway threads remain.

### BUG-006: Viewer Shifted Down

File:

- `src/java/billiards/viewer/Viewer.java`

Bug:

The reflected viewer could appear shifted down because `updateReflection()` translated by `imageStack.getBoundsInLocal().getHeight()`. The stack lives in a `BorderPane` center and can receive more vertical layout height than the actual 600x600 image.

Fix:

Pinned `imageStack` min/pref/max size to `SIDE x SIDE` and changed the reflection translation to `SIDE`.

Philosophy:

The reflection transform should flip the drawing surface, not the parent layout area. The map and image pixels are defined in `0..SIDE`, so the transform should also use `SIDE`.

Conditions:

Main viewer with Reflect selected, especially in windows taller than the 600px image.

Significance:

High for volunteer usability. If the viewer is visibly displaced, users will distrust the build.

Validation:

Compile passed. Manual launch required: verify the viewer is centered and stable, then toggle Reflect repeatedly.

### FEAT-001: Top Calculate Add-To-Cover Checkbox

Files:

- `src/java/billiards/viewer/Viewer.java`
- `src/java/billiards/viewer/CoverWindow.java`

Feature:

Added `Add to Cover` next to the existing top Calculate button. This does not add a second Calculate button or a new polygon box.

Behavior:

- Existing Calculate still calculates and draws as before.
- If `Add to Cover` is checked, Calculate also tries to append the result to the Cover window.
- Stable singles are appended to the stable cover text.
- Stable-unstable-stable triples are appended to the triple cover text.
- Unstable singles are skipped because the Cover window does not directly store them as stable cover entries.
- Empty or incomplete results are skipped.
- Exact duplicate lines are skipped before append.

Philosophy:

This mirrors the useful cover-writing behavior of the Li pattern/iteration flow, but keeps the main UI simple: one checkbox, one existing Calculate action.

Conditions:

Use when a volunteer calculates a known stable or triple and wants it in the Cover window immediately.

Significance:

Medium release usability. Reduces copy/paste errors and makes testing cover workflows easier.

Validation:

Compile passed. Manual tests:

1. Check `Add to Cover`.
2. Calculate a stable single twice.
3. Verify the Cover window receives one line, not two.
4. Calculate a valid stable-unstable-stable triple twice.
5. Verify the triple area receives one line, not two.

### OPT-001: Cover Info Annotation

File:

- `src/java/billiards/viewer/CoverWindow.java`

Issue:

`redoInfo` rescanned all pre-info lines for every info line.

Fix:

Builds a lookup map once, making the operation O(n+m).

Philosophy:

Large cover folders can contain thousands of lines. Repeated full scans are unnecessary and make UI tasks feel frozen.

Significance:

Medium performance.

Validation:

Compile passed. Manual large cover output comparison recommended.

### OPT-002: Code Sequence Canonicalization

Files:

- `src/backend/cpp/code_sequence.cpp`
- `src/backend/headers/code_sequence.hpp`
- `src/test/headers/code_sequence_test.hpp`

Issue:

Canonicalizing rotations/reversals used an O(n^2)-style rotate/compare scan.

Fix:

Added least-rotation logic and `rotated_copy`, then compares forward and reversed representatives in O(n). Also caches `CodeSequence::type()` because code sequences are immutable after construction.

Philosophy:

This is core math plumbing. It must preserve canonical equivalence while reducing cost on long code sequences.

Conditions:

Long code sequence parsing, classification, vary, and database lookup.

Significance:

Medium performance, high confidence due native regression test.

Validation:

`testBackend` ran 31 Boost tests with no errors.

### OPT-003: Cover Evaluator Allocation

Files:

- `src/backend/cpp/evaluator.cpp`
- `src/backend/headers/evaluator.hpp`
- `src/backend/cpp/common.cpp`
- `src/backend/cpp/verify.cpp`

Issue:

Hot cover paths repeatedly constructed MPFR/MPFI evaluator state.

Fix:

Added thread-local evaluator reuse per worker thread and precision.

Philosophy:

MPFR/MPFI allocation is expensive and mostly scratch-state. Reuse reduces allocation churn while keeping thread isolation.

Conditions:

Cover recursion, MRR, long OSNO cover work.

Significance:

High memory/performance.

Validation:

Compile passed. Manual memory plateau test still required.

### OPT-004: AutoVary Pixel Reader Caching

Files:

- `src/java/billiards/viewer/PolyVaryTask.java`
- `src/java/billiards/viewer/CycleVaryTask.java`

Issue:

Pixel reads were serialized through repeated JavaFX calls and traversal was shuffled.

Fix:

Snapshot `PixelReader` and dimensions once, remove per-coordinate JavaFX round trips, and keep deterministic traversal.

Philosophy:

Background search should not depend on thousands of tiny UI-thread calls.

Significance:

Medium performance and stability.

Validation:

Compile passed. Manual AutoVary/CycleVary cancellation and edge tests remain.

### OPT-005: Render Pipeline

Files:

- `src/java/billiards/viewer/Viewer.java`
- `src/java/billiards/viewer/Utils.java`

Issue:

Full redraws could submit per-pixel work and stale renders could overwrite newer renders.

Fix:

Changed redraw to row-batched futures. Added guarded render coalescing for the long-lived viewer executor. Coalescing is disabled when there is only one worker to avoid same-executor deadlock.

Philosophy:

Rendering should be parallel enough to be responsive, but old render jobs must not win the race and paint stale images after a newer user action.

Conditions:

Rapid zoom, reflect toggles, cover loads, large region render.

Significance:

Medium/high UI performance.

Validation:

Compile passed. Manual rapid UI redraw testing still required.

### OPT-006: Polygon Refinement Micro-Consolidation

Files:

- `src/backend/cpp/equations.cpp`
- `src/backend/cpp/refine.cpp`
- `src/backend/headers/refine.hpp`

Issue:

Most Nick Shan Linux P1/P2 parallel refinement was already present or ported differently, but one copy reduction remained useful.

Fix:

Moved refined polygon results instead of copying in `intersect_one_way`; clarified comments around parallel polygon intersection.

Philosophy:

Only port Linux changes that remain meaningful after Abdul Windows' existing TBB/worker-count implementation.

Significance:

Low performance, low risk.

Validation:

`testBackend` passed 31 native tests.

### OPT-007: Pattern Finder StringBuilder

Files:

- `src/java/patternfinder/PatUtils.java`
- `src/java/patternfinder/PatternFinder.java`

Issue:

Repeated `String +=` output construction could become O(n^2) for large pattern output.

Fix:

Converted the output-building paths to `StringBuilder`.

Philosophy:

Keep output formatting the same, but avoid copying the accumulated result on every append.

Significance:

Low/medium performance. Useful for large pattern output.

Validation:

Java compile and tests passed. Manual output comparison recommended.

### OPT-008: User Worker-Count Control

Files:

- `src/java/billiards/viewer/Main.java`
- `src/java/billiards/viewer/Utils.java`
- `src/java/billiards/wrapper/Wrapper.java`
- `src/backend/headers/utils.hpp`
- `src/backend/headers/wrapper.hpp`
- `src/backend/cpp/wrapper.cpp`

Issue:

Volunteers need a simple way to limit CPU use. Java and native code had separate knobs, and native default behavior did not cleanly follow the UI process.

Fix:

Added:

- `--threads=N`
- `--billiards-threads=N`
- Java default: half of `Runtime.availableProcessors()`
- User clamp: `1..availableProcessors-1`, or 1 on a 1-core machine
- Native default: half of `std::thread::hardware_concurrency()`
- Native setter: `backend_set_worker_threads(int32_t)`
- JNA bridge: `Wrapper.configureNativeThreads(Utils.numThreads)`

Philosophy:

Volunteer builds need one obvious launch argument. Java should own the release-facing setting and push the same resolved value into C++.

Conditions:

Any long calculation, cover, vary, AutoVary, or render-heavy testing.

Significance:

High for stability and volunteer machine usability.

Example:

```powershell
.\gradlew.bat --no-daemon run --args="--threads=2"
```

Validation:

Compile passed. Manual launch should confirm console output:

```text
Threads available: 2
```

### ARCH-001: Native DB Connection Ownership

File:

- `src/backend/cpp/wrapper.cpp`

Issue:

Some native picture-loading paths held SQLite pooled connections during expensive geometry compute.

Fix:

Split load into short existence check, connection-free compute, short save, and short final load.

Philosophy:

SQLite handles are scarce. Long native compute should not monopolize a DB connection while other workers are waiting.

Conditions:

Concurrent AutoVary/storage workers and normal picture loading.

Significance:

Medium/high concurrency stability.

Validation:

Compile passed. Concurrent DB stress test still recommended.

### ARCH-002: Database Path Relocation

Status:

Deferred by user.

Reason:

Nick Shan Linux moved database location, but Abdul Windows should not change user-data paths without migration planning.

### BUILD-001: Native C++ Test Runner

File:

- `build.gradle`

Issue:

The Windows backend linked with `-ltbb12`, but the native test executable linked with `-ltbb`. `testBackend` also did not put MSYS2 DLLs on `PATH`.

Fix:

Aligned Windows native tests to `-ltbb12` and added `${msys2NativePrefix}/bin` to `testBackend` PATH.

Philosophy:

Native tests must use the same dependency environment as `backend.dll`; otherwise tests fail even when production builds.

Significance:

Medium build/test reliability.

Validation:

`testBackend` ran 31 Boost tests with no errors.

### BUILD-002: Release Docs And Ignore Rules

Files:

- `.gitignore`
- `AGENTS.md`
- `docs/release/**`

Issue:

Useful docs existed outside the Abdul repo, and local generated artifacts were easy to commit accidentally.

Fix:

Added:

- `docs/release/README.md`
- `docs/release/BUILD-RUN-GUIDE.md`
- this report
- copied human-readable reference docs into `docs/release/reference`
- repo-local `AGENTS.md`
- expanded `.gitignore` for Gradle caches, IDE metadata, temp files, cover output, crash/profiling dumps

Philosophy:

The release bundle should not depend on a separate workspace docs folder. Future agents should also have repo-local rules.

Important caveat:

Some generated files such as `.gradle`, `cover`, `tmp`, and `middleVary3.txt` were already tracked historically. `.gitignore` does not untrack existing files. Removing those from version control should be a deliberate separate cleanup.

## Gradle And Build Changes

The build now supports the practical Windows path:

- Detects MSYS2 root from `MSYS2_ROOT`, defaulting to `C:/msys64`.
- Picks `BILLIARDS_MSYS2_PREFIX` if set.
- Otherwise prefers UCRT64 when `ucrt64/bin/g++.exe` exists.
- Adds MSYS2 include and Eigen include paths on Windows.
- Links Windows backend with `-lgmp -lmpfr -lmpfi -lsqlite3 -ltbb12 -lboost_thread-mt -lws2_32`.
- Links Windows native tests with `-lboost_unit_test_framework-mt ... -ltbb12 -lboost_thread-mt -lws2_32`.
- Adds MSYS2 bin to runtime `PATH` for `run`.
- Adds MSYS2 bin to `testBackend`.
- Keeps Java target/source at 17.
- Keeps user runtime heap settings at 2g/10g/2g.
- Adds native debug option with `-PbilliardsNativeDebug=true`.
- Keeps `-Og` instead of `-O0` for native debug because unused legacy helper references can make `-O0` link fail.
- Keeps compile load lower with `gradle.properties`.

## New User-Facing Behavior

### Main Calculate Add To Cover

The top input row now has:

```text
[code input] [Calculate] [Add to Cover]
```

This is intentionally a checkbox, not a new action button. It modifies the existing Calculate behavior only when selected.

Duplicate behavior:

- Exact matching stable line already in Cover -> skip.
- Exact matching triple line already in Cover -> skip.
- Different comments/spacing can still be treated as different lines.

### Thread Count

Default:

```text
half of available logical processors
```

Override:

```powershell
.\gradlew.bat --no-daemon run --args="--threads=4"
```

Bounds:

- minimum 1
- maximum `availableProcessors - 1`
- if the machine reports 1 processor, maximum is 1

Native C++:

Java pushes the resolved worker count into C++ with `backend_set_worker_threads`. Native-only scripts can still use `BILLIARDS_NATIVE_THREADS` when Java does not call the setter.

Some native algorithms still pass an explicit local maximum to `billiards_worker_count(max)`. Those caps remain because they are algorithm-specific safety limits.

## Known Remaining Risks

### Manual UI Testing Still Needed

Compile tests cannot prove JavaFX layout correctness. Volunteers should test:

1. Main viewer opens with the image centered and not shifted down.
2. Reflect off/on does not move the image vertically.
3. Calculate with `Add to Cover` adds one stable line.
4. Repeating the same Calculate does not duplicate the line.
5. Valid stable-unstable-stable triples add once to the triple cover area.
6. Unstable singles do not get incorrectly written as stable cover entries.
7. Cover window text persists when closed and reopened.
8. Cover, Small Cover, and Stables save state when the main app closes.
9. AutoVary and CycleVary cancel preserve partial progress.
10. Rapid zoom/toggle/load actions do not flash stale renders.

### Memory Testing Still Needed

The old Main runtime reportedly reached very high virtual memory after large OSNO work and did not release it promptly. Abdul Windows now has evaluator reuse and several allocation-pressure fixes, but native memory should still be tested with `docs/procwatch.ps1`, Task Manager, or VMMap:

1. Launch with `--threads=2`.
2. Run a small cover.
3. Run a known large OSNO cover.
4. Cancel during a large run.
5. Repeat the run.
6. Confirm memory plateaus after worker warmup instead of increasing unboundedly.

`docs/procwatch.ps1` is the quick first-pass tool for this: start the app, run the script from another PowerShell, and watch private memory, virtual memory, working set, CPU time, and thread count once per second.

### Database Race Testing Still Needed

The wrapper now releases DB connections during compute. This is better for pool pressure, but concurrent workers can still race to compute and save the same missing code. Test concurrent AutoVary/storage flows and watch for duplicate-save SQLite errors.

### Database Relocation Deferred

Do not move database paths for this release.

## Release Smoke Test Checklist

Build:

```powershell
.\gradlew.bat --no-daemon compileJava backendSharedLibrary testBackend test
```

Launch:

```powershell
.\gradlew.bat --no-daemon run --args="--threads=2"
```

UI:

- Main viewer not shifted.
- Reflect toggle stable.
- Calculate stable with add-to-cover.
- Duplicate stable skipped.
- Calculate triple with add-to-cover.
- Duplicate triple skipped.
- Cover window close/reopen preserves text.
- Main window close saves Cover/Small Cover/Stables text.

Performance:

- Run one small cover.
- Run one larger OSNO cover.
- Watch RAM and virtual memory.
- Run AutoVary near a zoomed/reflected edge.
- Cancel a long AutoVary and confirm partial progress remains.

## Reference Docs Included

Copied into this repo:

- `docs/release/reference/current-tracker/`
- `docs/release/reference/project-study/`
- `docs/release/reference/bug-audit/`
- `docs/release/reference/source-study/`

Raw Ghidra/CFR/class extraction artifacts were not copied into this release folder because they are large and not needed for volunteer setup. They remain in the wider workspace docs tree that was used as evidence during analysis.
